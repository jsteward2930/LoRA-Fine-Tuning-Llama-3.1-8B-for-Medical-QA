Jupyter Notebook: This is required to run the .ipynb file. You can install it using pip:

pip install notebook
Git: If you plan to clone the repository, ensure Git is installed. You can download it from git-scm.com.

Clone the Repository
To get the project files, clone the repository using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
Replace yourusername and repository-name with the appropriate values.

Install Required Packages
Navigate to the cloned repository directory:

cd repository-name
Next, install the required Python packages. It is recommended to use a virtual environment for managing dependencies. You can create a virtual environment using:

python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:

source venv/bin/activate
Now, install the necessary packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt
If a requirements.txt file is not provided, you may need to manually install the packages used in the notebook.

Launch Jupyter Notebook
Once the installation is complete, you can launch Jupyter Notebook with the following command:

jupyter notebook
This will open a new tab in your web browser. From there, navigate to the LoRA_Fine_Tuning_of_Llama_3_1_8B_for_Medical_QA.ipynb file and start working with the notebook.

Additional Notes
Ensure that your environment has access to the necessary hardware (e.g., GPU) if required for fine-tuning tasks.
Refer to the notebook for any specific configurations or additional dependencies that may be needed.
By following these steps, you should be able to successfully set up the environment to run the fine-tuning notebook.

Usage
## Usage

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook titled `LoRA_Fine_Tuning_of_Llama_3_1_8B_for_Medical_QA.ipynb`, which demonstrates how to fine-tune the Llama 3 model (8B parameters) specifically for medical question-answering tasks using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).

### Steps to Use the Notebook

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   To get started, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
   cd repository-name
Set Up Your Environment: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. It is recommended to use a virtual environment. You can create one using:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Then, install the required packages. If a requirements.txt file is provided, you can install dependencies with:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the Jupyter Notebook: Launch Jupyter Notebook in your terminal:

jupyter notebook
Navigate to the LoRA_Fine_Tuning_of_Llama_3_1_8B_for_Medical_QA.ipynb file and open it.

Run the Notebook: Follow the instructions within the notebook to fine-tune the Llama 3 model. The notebook contains detailed explanations and code snippets to guide you through the process.

Evaluate the Model: After fine-tuning, you can evaluate the model's performance on medical QA tasks as outlined in the notebook.

Additional Notes
Ensure you have access to the necessary computational resources, as fine-tuning large models like Llama 3 can be resource-intensive.
Modify the parameters and settings in the notebook as needed to suit your specific use case.
